# IGME-209 Project: DSA Pathfinder Project
This was the final project required for IGME-209. This project required students to work with a group of other students to create a DLL that implements A* pathfinding and other game logic such as menu options. I was responsible for implementing the adjacency matrix and the A* pathfinding, while my groupmates completed the menu interface and formatting to export the program to a DLL.
