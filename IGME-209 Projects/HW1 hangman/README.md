# IGME-209 Project: HW1 Hangman
C++ console application that displays an ASCII art game of hangman. The user must enter individual letters to guess parts of a word, which will then be revealed in the word if the guess was correct, or will be added to the list of wrong guesses if the guess was incorrect. The game ends when the player has guessed all of the letters of the word, or when the player has made 6 incorrect guesses. (NOTE: This application is case-sensitive, and only lower-case letters should be entered as guesses.)
