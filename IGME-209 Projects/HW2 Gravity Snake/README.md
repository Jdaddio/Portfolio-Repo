# IGME-209 Project: HW2 Gravity Snake
A C++ console application that uses the box2D physics engine to create a Snake game based on gravity. The console constantly outputs the position of the target and the position of the player's snake object, and uses player inputs to change the snake's position in space. The program pauses when the player hits 2 targets, allowing them to then end the program or continue. 
CONTROLS: WASD or ARROW KEYS to move, ESC to end the game
