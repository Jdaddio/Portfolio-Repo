# IGME-209 Project: HW3 Graphical Snake
This program uses much of the same C++ code as the HW2 Gravity Snake project, but with additional implementation of the SFML Graphical API to visually represent the game to the player. This application displays the snake as a circle and the targets as squares.
CONTROLS: WASD or ARROW KEYS to move, ESC to end the game, SPACE to reverse gravity, F to halt the snake's movement.
