            I made the site by referencing some of my older code that I had used for previous assignments, and throwing a lot of stuff together until it looked good. I used Coolors to get a color scheme I liked, and used trial and error to get the text and images aligned properly in their containers with a consistent design throughout. I kept my design simple, so that it would be easier to make responsive. My goal for the portfolio is to make something I can send potential employers to so that they can find out more about my skills and see what I have done, as well as contact me if they like what they see. My idea was to include my personal information (including contact information) at the top of the page, and include information about the projects I had completed towards the bottom of the page, all of which would be easily accessible via the navigation bar underneath my name and tagline. I had originally intended to include the navbar at the very top of the page, but realized it was a bit out of the way and didn't flow as well as if it was underneath my header. I originally had trouble getting every object on the page to look the same and stay the same size, but after taking a break and looking at it again later on I was able to get the design consistent. I did not include a second layout on the page, as I made all aspects of the page responsive on their own. If I update the page in the future, I will probably make my code a little simpler and consistent between the different containers. I experimented with both flexbox and grid in this design, and I managed to get everything working properly in the end, but if I can make the code simpler and easier to interpret I will. I may also add some additional graphics or graphical effects on the page to make it more visually engaging. 
            <br>The box at the top of the page starts at 1000px and gets smaller when the screen gets smaller, every other main container on the page is 80%.
