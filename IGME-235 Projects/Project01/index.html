                                    Changeling VR was the project I worked on for my Summer 2022 co-op through RIT. From May 15th through August 5th, I worked alongside a full team of developers on the Changeling Project, a VR narrative mystery game created entirely by RIT students & faculty. My role in the project as a member of the art team was to create and animate static 3D assets, animated character models, and visual effects which could be used to add detail and life to the in-game environments. Working on the Changeling VR Project gave me quite a bit of experience with 3D modeling, texturing, and animating in Blender, experience creating visual effects and physics scripting with blueprints in Unreal Engine 4, and experience working alongside a dedicated team of artists, designers and developers to achieve a common goal.

                                    Rotten Delirium was an academic project for IGME-320 Game Design and Development II, in which I and a group of four other students were tasked to develop an original game concept over the course of one semester. We decided to develop an open-world survival horror game, in which the player is tasked to survive the night and get home after getting lost in the forest on a Halloween night. The game features almost entirely original assets, including the terrain, environmental (nature) assets, and the monster that is currently in the game. I was responsible for creating the game's terrain layout and environmental models, the textures and shaders for the game's materials, the 3D model and animations for the monster, and the fog & lighting effects that give our game its mood. Rotten Delirium is still a work in progress, one our group plans to continue developing whenever we have time to do so.

                                    This project was my final project for IGME-219 3D Animation and Asset Production. The project requirements were to create an original 3D Render of a scene from the user's chosen fictional setting. In the project description, students were encouraged to challenge themselves, and to choose a setting from a favorite game of theirs, so I chose to create a 3D version of the Colosseum of Fools from Hollow Knight. To create this project, I used a variety of technologies, including Autodesk Maya to create accurate 3D Models, Quixel Mixer to to create the textures, Quixel Bridge to import the completed models into Unreal, and Unreal Engine 4.27.2 to assemble the scene and create the lighting effects.

                                    MineShip was my final IGME-235 Intro to Game Web Tech project, in which students were required to create an original web-based game or experience. For my project, I chose to create an infinite scrolling space-flight game, in which the player would mine ore while avoiding enemies and obstacles. I created this project using a small amount of HTML and a lot of JavaScript and PIXI.JS in Microsoft Visual Studio Code. My goal in creating the project was to gain a better understanding of JavaScript's game-making potential using PIXI.JS to draw the elements of the game on-screen in the browser. One of the greatest challenges I faced was figuring out how to use the PIXI.JS API to its fullest potential in the limited time I had to complete the final, though I am proud of the project that I created as a result of my efforts.

                                    The Anime Finder API Project was the second IGME-235 Intro to Game Web Tech project, in which students were expected to utilize an API in creating a functional JavaScript driven Web application. I chose to create a simple anime-browsing web application on which users could find anime or manga by name or genre, get information about any selected anime or manga that matched the search requirements, and then find more anime like the selected anime by using the API again to find anime that were similar to the selected one. This project was created using a mix of HTML, CSS and Javascript in Microsoft Visual Studio Code. Learning to use the provided API to search for anime proved to be a challenge, and I found that I had to create several of my own functions in order to achieve the functionality I wanted from some of the features on the website.
