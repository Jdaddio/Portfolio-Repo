                <blockquote>
                    My name is Joshua D'Addio. I am a second year Game Design and Development major at RIT. I am a big fan of 2D art and design, which was my original intended
                    major. I studied a lot of traditional 2D art in high school, but I still have some practice to do on my design work. I have also always been interested in 
                    videogames, however, which is why I jumped at the opportunity to be a part of the Game Design and Development major. I would love to be able to combine my
                    passions for art and game design when I go into the field and create fun and interesting art assets for games I work on. I hope to learn some of those design
                    skills I intend to work on in this class and utilize them when I can after the end of the semester! I also hope to get to better familiarize myself with a variety
                    of coding languages in this class and the other classes in my major and, when I graduate, be more than prepared to enter the game design field with confidence
                    and the skills I need to make a name for myself. When I graduate I hope to be able to work on the sorts of games I would like to work on with a group of people 
                    I can feel comfortable working with. I hope I am able to make use of the skills I gain in my time at RIT and the skills I have been polishing in my own time
                    over the course of my school career.
