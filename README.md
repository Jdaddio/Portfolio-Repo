# Portfolio-Repo
This is a Github Repository that contains most of the code projects I have completed during my education at Rochester Institute of Technology. Projects are organized by the classes they were completed for. All class folders and project folders should include a brief descriptive README file to give them context and make it easier to navigate the repository.
